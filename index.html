<p>Welcome to my long-overdue portfolio site. I've been meaning to set this up for a while now, just as a means of documenting all the various projects I've been involved in, and to have a place to store my dead projects instead of just throwing them in the recycling bin.</p><hr><br><br>
<p>The last project I worked on was founding an online research group, providing them with a platform that housed an end-to-end encrypted framework to share their findings, catalog information, and connect with other researchers. The project has strong roots in anonymity and privacy, so I can't exactly show it off (as much as I want to). It also hosted multiple "sister services", such as a federated identity provider, a self destructing notes service, etc. The logged-in user count high from this quarter was nearly 40,000 members, with 4 staff members needing to be hired on to continue development work and moderation while I pursued other interests. <br> <br><hr><br><br>I'm also a musician, with my forte generally being a blend of electronic and melodic. I was signed by DK Records and am a verified artist on Spotify, Apple Music, and wherever else you get your music. As of writing this, I currently have 2,341 monthly listeners on Spotify. <br><br><hr><br><br> I also have a YouTube channel with a couple thousand subscribers, but I'm still waiting to really put it to use. I do have a strong creative itch that, believe it or not, stil isn't completely scratched, but I'm just waiting for the right type of content to come along. I feel like I'm getting pretty close.<br><br><hr><br><br>I play a lot of video games, and have even dabbled a bit in game development. I worked on a horror game called "OutGen: Rewired", a first-person surival horror exploration game with a heavy focus on narrative. The basic story involved a rogue research group (no, no relation, I made this game years ago <_<) brainwashing it's members through VHS tapes that influenced the REM stage of their sleep, effectively weaponizing their own mind against themselves until they took their own lives. Yeah, I know, it's pretty dark. We didn't get very far. I'll leave a link to some footage from what I did manage to get done (keep in mind, this was my first time using Unity, but all things considered, I thought it came out pretty good). I had worked on this project with a good friend at the time. <br><br><hr><br><br> I am highly proficient using a variety of software and tools, which I'll go into more detail in the "Tools" section of the website.<br><br><hr><br><br> I own just about every gaming console from every generation, and every single one (besides the impossible ones) are modded in some way, usually my goal is to either get linux booted, or RetroArch running. My list of succesfully hacked consoles are: Nintendo Wii, PlayStation 2, Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Microsoft Xbox, Microsoft Xbox 360 (RGH), Xbox One/Series S (NOT under dev mode, I have my own RetroArch build published on the Microsoft store - don't tell them, please), PS Vita, PSP-2000, and formerly a 3DS XL. I'm currently eyeing a New 2DS XL or New 3DS XL (Probably Japanese Import), but they're some expensive little dudes. <br><br><hr><br><br> I wrote a plugin for BetterDiscord (also an extension for TamperMonkey on browsers) called "Raindrop" that allows users to encrypt messages between each other with AES-256 bit cryptography and fully functional key signatures. A key manager was then added into the Discord client itself. It's continued to work alongside every Discord update, but I'm moreso interested in the future of the Fosscord project (now known as Spacebar for legal reasons.) <br><br><hr><br><br>

      <p>A web-based operating system parody that is beyond impressive, coded by the brilliant ctrl+z and a friend of his. For a brief period of time I coded a few programs that are used on the operating system, with plans to create a larger ARG for an upcoming release, but it wouldn't have been finished before the deadline.</p>

      <p>Hahahaha. I had a period of time where I was hosting various e-mail servers with vanity domain names, such as ego.rip, ego.cat, dna.rip, waterfalls.lol, blackmesa.id, and of course, dea.gay. I sold it to a good friend who hasn't touched it in years, and it's now forever immortalized as a URL shortener. Glorious.</p>

<span class="title">Read Only Memories (EP) on Spotify</span>
<p>By far my most experimental music release - 5 tracks that are all similar in nature, but also, not really at all in the slightest and I don't know why you'd think that. (Seriously though, they're all unfinished, but all have something really cool about them that almost felt like solving a puzzle. I highly recommend Fool's Moon, it's by FAR the one I'm most proud of. When I made that I just sat in my chair for about 30 minutes listening to it on repeat with a big smile on my face. That and "I Painted The Sky" for an atmosphere that's so relaxing it should be illegal.</p>
